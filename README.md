## Fullstack Challenge
The goal of this challenge is to assess your general domain knowledge of web development.

### Summary
Develop a simple weather application with 2 components.
1. A simple front end which displays a 7 day forecast of the weather,users should be able to view only 14 days in total
2. A simple rest api should be created which the front end will interface with in order to access the weather data

### Requirements
1. It is not expected for you to create a DB server, feel free to reference a static file for the weather data (CSV file for example)
2. Please be sure to utilize PHP, JS, HTML, and CSS. 
3. Please provide Unit testing for the data store handling. 
4. (Optional) User authorization checks. 
5. (Optional) Postman scripts to access the API from. 

### Rules
1. You must utilize a front end framework like angular or react
2. Instructions must be included to run this codebase locally
4. Include comments in your code
5. Create a fork of this repo and send the url of the fork once finished to jg@signingdaysports.com and andrew@signingdaysports.com

### Getting Started
The provided machine has all required libraries, if anything else is required via apt-get or npm install, please make a comment of what else 
was utilized. We have provided a generic React service as a starting point, run ```npm start``` from the ```weather-api``` directory to start this 
service. 

### Suggestions
1. While design is not critical, having the interface be accessible is crucial
2. Feel free to overwrite this file when creating your codebase
3. Be clear how and why you chose your data model for the weather data
